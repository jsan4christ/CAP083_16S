# CAP083 16S Data Analysis

## Introduction

In this analysis, we asses the effect of BV treatment on the microbiome.

## The Workflow

The workflow begins with output from SpeciateIT (http://ravel-lab.org/speciateit) and converts it into components required by Phyloseq for downstream analysis. This is accomplished through the script https://github.com/jsan4christ/CAP083_16S/blob/master/scripts/process_pecan_output.R

The rest of the workflow is compiled into Rmarkdown and begins from index.Rmd in the document home directory.
